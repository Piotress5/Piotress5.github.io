            My name is Piotr and I am passionate about Web Development. Since a year I am keeping in touch with Front-end related news 
            and I keep making progress in that field to improve even more with every day. To ensure that, I am challenging myself with 
            new projects and pushing my boundaries further.

        <p class="about-text">
            My adventure with IT has started in middle school. At that time, I became familiar with Scratch and got extremely satisfied 
            with creating something that actually works. I created some simple games, which were mostly for fun and stuff, but turned into 
            greater plans that I never completed. (However, I am going to recreate some of them as I want to finally fulfill my old wish.)
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            Back in high school, I started to learn IT for good, along with Web Development a bit later on. At first, it made me some troubles, 
            because of loads of new knowledge. It overwhelmed be, so I began doubting my own skills. Then I decided to slow down and learn everything 
            step by step with no rush at my own pace. As time passed, I was getting more acquainted with IT. After some time, I learned how good I am 
            in creating things and how much entertainment it gave me. I felt really satisfied.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            After graduating high school, I decided to take a break. I had to rethink some aspects of my life. Despite all these events and experiences, 
            I was unsure about myself. Many people said much things about how my future should look like. After a year, I made my mind. I reminded myself 
            of all these times when I felt happy about my work. Even some new ideas had begun to appear in my head. I realized my destiny. So I started 
            to relearn forgotten knowledge. At the end of summer 2023, my first real project has been completed: Calculator. First version of it wasn't 
            astonishing, but it was working and that mattered to me.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Now, I am going forward in my own pace, striving to slowly improve, day by day. Consistently writing and developing new skills, I do it all 
          with same thought, that helped me go through the life back in the days: to have fun of what I am doing and to keep going, no matter what happens.
